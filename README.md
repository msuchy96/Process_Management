Application supporting task planning for an agile organization employee</br></br>
<b>Abstract</b></br>
The aim of this thesis was to design, implement and test an application on CRM platform that enables planning, monitoring and analyzing processes created from consecutive jobs. The application should be designed in such a way that it can serve any agile organization or those who want to implement agile elements for their work, regardless of the field they deals with. The key aspect was realization of organization virtualization, where employees using system functionalities can independently organize their work and transfer the most important elements of the company management to one program. The implemented process creator helps in managing processes consisting of tasks in the form of directed acyclic graphs which supports quick work reconfiguration to find the most cost-effective solution. Triggers which are responsible for application logic during operations on the integrated database have used the delegation pattern in order to protect from errors related to the limits imposed by the platform and help in further development of the application.
